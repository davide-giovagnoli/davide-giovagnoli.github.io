Currently, I am a PhD student at University of Bologna, Italy, working under the supervision of Prof. [Fausto Ferrari](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/fausto.ferrari).

My research interests lie primarily in **Regularity theory of local and nonlocal PDES**, **Elliptic and parabolic free boundary problems** and **Calculus of variations**.

I will finish my PhD in October 2026.
Feel free to reach out to me via email at <d.giovagnoli@unibo.it>.
